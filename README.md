# WS2812b_STM32F103C8
Hi. This is a code, who can help linking your WS2812b LED and STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller. This code based on project https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChButpZaL5kUUl_zTyIDFkQ,
but I added a function to change the effect when you sending various commands. Also, the ability to control the tape via bluetooth is added, for this you need to install a Bluetooth 
Terminal Application on your Android device. The code is written in the CooCoxIDE.
